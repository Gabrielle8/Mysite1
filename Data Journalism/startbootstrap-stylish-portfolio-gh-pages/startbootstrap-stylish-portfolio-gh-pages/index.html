The MTREF (Medium Term Revenue and Expenditure Framework) is displayed in years 2018/2019 and 2019/2020. This is the estimated budget  breakdown for the next two years.

        <h2 align="center"color="#28AD80"> Informal Settlement and Backyarders Department </h2>
        
        <p> The main focus of the Informal Settlements and Backyarders Department is to “upgrade and improve informal settlements and to provide services to backyard dwellers, and to consolidate the provision of bulk services, janitorial services,  EPWP opportunities, taps and toilet installations.” The department is also responsible for managing environmental health and social services, including disaster and emergency services. 
The graph below shows a drastic drop in the informal settlement capital expenditure  from 2014 to 2020. This could be due to the newly distributed departments. Human Settlements Department became Informal Settlements and Backyarders in 2017. This decrease in budget, however, still insinuated that the City Of Cape Town is not pro poor.

        <p align='center'> The solid waste department oversees the removal of animal carcasses on public land and roads, as well as the cleaning and collection of refuse in informal settlements. They provide waste management planning advice to all partnerships and cleansing services to special events within the City
 
During 2014/2017 there was a slight decline in the capital expenditure in the Solid waste department. This is in contrast with the large increase in capital expenditure from 2017/2020. 
 
This allocation in 2014/15 represents just over R4 524 million or 74.4% of the total budgetary allocation for the year. Utility Services receives the largest allocation of R2 872 million in 2014/15, which represents 47.2% of the budget.
Utility Services includes the services responsible for the provision of electricity, solid waste, water and sanitation.
A large portion of the Water and sanitation goes to major Water Projects such asBulk Water Augmentation Scheme,Water supply Baden Powell to Khayelitsha ,and Distribution to Belhar CBD. 
Below is a table displaying the Capital budget for specific areas within Cape Town for the wastewater treatment.

Out of the 29 Ward allocated funds within Vote 8, 9 is dedicated to lower income wards, while 5 is dedicated to middle income wards and 15 to higher income wards. 52% of the funds mentioned in the ward allocation budget goes to wards with higher average household income. This indicates that the budget is not in fact pro poor.

Majority of the Vote 8’s budget is placed in the solid waste management department in projects such as area cleaning. Only two wards are allocated a budget for Job Creation the rest of the wards are allocated a budget for area cleaning projects and street sweeping.

2017/2018  budget allocation per Ward does not display the budget allocation per ward for water and sanitation, and informal settlements and backyarders department, however in the above graphs the budget for each department within Vote 8 is clearly stipulated.

                   With the information provided in the 2014/2015 2017/2018 budget and ward allocation budget it is clear that specific information on how the allocated budget is spent is made clear for departments of solid waste management. The other two wards, informal settlements and backyarders, water and sanitation were not mentioned in the Ward budget outline. Information on the total spending of the budget, not by ward distribution, was available. With all the information above it can be claimed that the Vote 8 budget for informal settlements, water, and waste management is not pro poor as 52% if its ward allocation budget goes to ward with higher income. Further research shows that informal settlements budget is largely spent on USDG, resulting in only 11.3% going to informal settlements and backyarders.
